# Wayland Clipboard Sync

Synchronizes the clipboard across multiple wayland instances running on the same machine.

Example use case: You use gnome as your primary desktop environment, but you use another wayland compositor, like sway, within a window to consoldiate all your messenger apps into a single tabbed window. If you want to copy and paste anything from your messenger apps in sway to the other apps in gnome, you'll need wayland clipboard sync to synchronize the sway and gnome clipboards.
